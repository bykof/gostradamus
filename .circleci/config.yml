  # This build job just tests that the binary can build. If your project is a
  # library, not a binary, you don't need this build job. In other words, omit
  # this job if you don't have a func main() in your project.
  build:
    docker:
      - image: golang:1.14-alpine
    working_directory: /go/src/gostradamus

      # github.com/foo/bar/cmd/baz is the import path to your main module. Your
      # func main() should be in a file in the cmd/<binary name>/ directory. The
      # import path should be <module name>/cmd/<binary name>
      #
      # If you are planning to publish this binary as a release artifact, you
      # should do the following:
      # 1. Set CGO_ENABLED: '0' in the environment block. Put the '0' in single
      #    quotes. This will produce a statically linked binary (no runtime
      #    dependencies). Since this is an alpine container, it will statically
      #    link musl libc into the binary. musl is smaller and more secure than
      #    glibc, but if you have any problems, change the container from
      #    golang:1.14-alpine to golang:1.14. Then glibc will be statically
      #    linked instead.
      # 2. go install -ldflags '-s -w' github.com/foo/bar/cmd/baz
      #    -ldflags '-s -w' means strip the debug symbols from the binary. This
      #    significantly shrinks the binary size and is a security best practice.
